## Goal of the project  
Wanted to learn aspects of Backend and since I like games it didn't sit well with me to make a boring "To do app", soo I decided to make a Turn base RPG browser game. On this journey I learned a lot about Flask, HTML, CSS, communication with databases and most importantly didn't want to learn JavaScript for this project soo using Jinja 2 for dynamic communication between frontend and backend
helped a lot.  
Game is currently in it's infancy and currently you can only play it on local host. Furthermore, chances of it getting finished are slim but never none. The main goal of learning and getting exposed to the concepts of backend and frontend is achieved :).

## Features  
1. **Cretaing character**  
   * During character creation your stats are randomized **based on the difficulty** you chose(normal is default), you can reroll as many times as you want and invest your stats points which is very important because to **choose** a class you have to pass certain stats tresh hold for example if you want to be Druid you should have at least**str**: 12 and **int**: 12.

2. **Choosing Character**  
   * Here you can choose or delete a character, on the screenshot below it looks like the screen cuts the third character but thats just overflowing feature of scroll.

3. **Fighting**  
   * When fighting, a character with the **higher speed** movies first and on your turn you can choose who you are attacking and when you kill enough of them you get to lvl up and spend points to increase stats. Furthermore, you can see in the **combat report** below what happend this turn.

## Getting Started
Before getting access to the game there is couple of things you should do:
1. **Clone repository** - `https://github.com/gitLonan/Flask-projects.git`
2. **Create virtual environment**
   * Windows (cmd or PowerShell) - `python -m venv venv`
   * Mac & Linux (Terminal) - `python3 -m venv venv`
3. **Activate virtual environment**
   * Windows(PowerShell) - `venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
   * Windows (CMD) - `virtual\Scripts\activate.bat`
   * macOS/Linux - `virtual/bin/activate`
4. **Run dependencies.sh file**  
   If by any chance it doesn't work you can install all of these on their own, just make sure you are inside of the virtual environment: 
      * `pip install flask`
      * `pip install "flask<3" "werkzeug<3"`
      * `pip install flask-wtf`
      * `pip install flask-sqlalchemy`
      * `pip install flask-migrate`
      * `pip install python-dotenv`
